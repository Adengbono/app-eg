            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>According to statistics, about me pages are among the ten most visited by potential customers on your site.

The “about us” page is a must-have page (this can be a page on your website, 
separate landing page or even “about me” website as a type of portfolio) used by all
 types of businesses i love but i goh dgh
 to give customers more insight into who is involved with a given business and exactly what it does.
Your “About me” page forms the first impression of a company or product, puts a name and a
 face to your business, and gives website visitor the opportunity to develop a connection with you 
 (a good reason for a visitor to stay on your website!), and it is your best chance to
 convert more visits to enquiries/more enquiries to customers.</p>
